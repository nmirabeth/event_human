# Human-centered applications of event data 

This is the official repository of "Event-based solutions for human-centered applications: A comprehensive review" submitted to Frontiers in Signal Processing journal.

Event cameras, or dynamic vision sensors, capture changes in light intensity asynchronously, providing high temporal resolution and energy efficiency. These features make them ideal for human-centered applications, such as analyzing facial expressions and body motion dynamics. However, research in this area is fragmented. This repository unifies advancements in body and face-related tasks, offering a comprehensive review of databases, event data representation, and processing models. It serves as a foundational resource for researchers, guiding future work in human-centered event camera applications.
